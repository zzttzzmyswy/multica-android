 * mentions already preview this way via MentionHoverCard
 * (packages/ui/components/common/mention-hover-card.tsx); this is the issue

 * mounts the popup only while the card is open, so this component adds no
 * request of its own until a card opens. Moving a query up into IssueHoverCard
 * would fire one per mention on render. (The chip inside the trigger has its
 * own unresolved-issue fetch; that is independent of this.)
