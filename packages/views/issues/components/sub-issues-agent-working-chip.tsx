 * Aggregate "N agents working" chip for the sub-issues header in issue
 * detail (multica#5825). The per-row IssueAgentActivityIndicator answers
 * "which sub-issue is being worked on"; this chip answers "how many agents
 * are on this parent's children right now" without scanning the rows — and
 * keeps that signal visible while the list is collapsed.
 *
 * It reads the same /api/working-agents projection as the Issues list header,
 * narrowed with `parent`. That is deliberate: a header count is a claim about
 * a scope, so the server owns both the scope and the arithmetic, exactly as
 * it does for the Issues list. Deriving it here from the workspace task
 * snapshot would put a second definition of "working" in the client, and the
 * count and the hover body would each have to re-derive it.
 *
 * Row indicators keep reading the snapshot — one shared query sliced per row
 * is the right shape for a per-row cue, and a stale row decoration costs
 * nothing. A header number is the opposite: it has to be authoritative.
