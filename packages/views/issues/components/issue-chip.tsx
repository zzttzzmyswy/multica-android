/**
 * Compact, presentation-only representation of an issue —
 * `<StatusIcon> <identifier> <title>`, bordered, with the title truncating to
 * an ellipsis once the chip hits its width cap.
 *
 * The cap is `min(18rem, 100%)` — two limits doing two different jobs:
 *   - `18rem` bounds the chip against the *content*, so a long title can never
 *     grow the chip wide enough to dominate a line of prose. Without it a chip
 *     is an atomic inline box that wraps to the next line as a unit whenever it
 *     doesn't fit at the current position, leaving a ragged gap on the line
 *     above — the reference-dense-prose problem from #6732.
 *   - `100%` bounds it against the *container*, keeping the chip inside narrow
 *     parents such as a chat bubble.
 * `ProjectChip` carries the identical cap; the two must not drift.
 *
 * The cap lives here (single source of truth) — wrappers must NOT add their own
 * flex container around it, or a percentage cap gets dropped during the
 * wrapper's intrinsic sizing and the clickable box diverges from the truncated
 * chip.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for the "issue-mention card" look.
 * It is intentionally **not** a link or button: callers wrap it in whatever
 * interactive shell they need (AppLink for markdown mentions, an <a> with
 * cmd-click support inside the editor's NodeView, a plain span next to a
 * dismiss button in chat's context anchor card, …).
 *
 * Size budget: must fit within a 14px line-box when used inline — hence
 * `py-0.5` + text-caption (see MentionView docstring for the math).
