/**
 * The unified await-then-render send contract for every composer (MUL-5181).
 *
 * Before this hook, comment-input, reply-input, comment-card (edit),
 * create-issue, and quick-create each hand-copied the same six-step
 * "pessimistic submit": read markdown, guard empty/in-flight, re-read
 * the upload gate, lock + spin, await the server, and clear only on success
 * (keep the draft on failure). The copies drifted — some guarded single-flight
 * with a ref, some with a state boolean a render behind; some re-checked the
 * upload gate at submit time, some trusted the disabled button. This
 * centralizes the contract so every surface behaves identically.
 *
 * It is deliberately await-then-render, NOT optimistic: the composer keeps the
 * user's text and attachments in place (send affordance locked and spinning)
 * until the server accepts the submission, then clears. A slow send never
 * looks like "posted but the box is still full", and a rejected send keeps the
 * draft for retry instead of silently dropping it. The editor itself stays
 * interactive (Tiptap cannot toggle editable post-mount), so callers' accepted
 * handlers guard on a submit-time snapshot: success clears ONLY the draft it
 * submitted, and anything typed during the request survives.
