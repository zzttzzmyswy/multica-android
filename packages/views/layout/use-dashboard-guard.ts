/**
 * Auth + workspace gate for the dashboard.
 *
 * Redirect logic:
 *  - Auth still loading → wait
 *  - Not logged in → /login
 *  - Logged in but workspace list not yet loaded → wait (don't bounce prematurely)
 *  - Logged in but URL slug doesn't resolve to any workspace →
 *    `resolvePostAuthDestination(list, hasOnboarded)` (workspace-presence first;
 *    see paths/resolve.ts for the full table)
 *
 * This guard only redirects when the URL slug doesn't resolve. Onboarding
 * itself marks the user onboarded before navigating into a workspace, so
 * entering the dashboard no longer depends on a follow-up Helper modal.
 *
 * (Older comment claimed this state was physically impossible because
 * CreateWorkspace and AcceptInvitation atomically marked onboarded.
 * CreateWorkspace no longer marks; AcceptInvitation still does — invitees
 * skip the modal entirely.)
 *
 * We read the workspace list query state directly (rather than relying on
 * useCurrentWorkspace's null return) so we can distinguish "list loading"
 * from "slug not found". Otherwise users could see a transient redirect
 * before their workspace list arrives.
