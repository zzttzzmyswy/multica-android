/**
 * The description line under a detail page's title. Clamped to two lines, with
 * a toggle that appears only when there is something clamped to reveal.
 *
 * Left unclamped, a long description pushes the meta row and the tab strip
 * down the page, so how far the content starts depends on how much prose
 * someone wrote. Two lines is where the agent and skill headers already sit
 * visually; the toggle is what makes clamping safe, since without it the rest
 * of the text has nowhere to be — this IS the detail page, so expanding in
 * place is the only move that does not send the reader somewhere else to read
 * one paragraph.
 *
 * The toggle is deliberately quiet — muted until hovered, matching the
 * "show more" control on the agent activity tab. Brand colour is reserved for
 * primary actions and live state; this page's Save and Add-to-agent buttons
 * are what should be drawing the eye, not a text expander.
