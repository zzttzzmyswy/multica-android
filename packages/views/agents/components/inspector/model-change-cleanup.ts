 * the new model never advertised leaves an orphan override that the daemon
 * silently drops at execution time, so the settings page would claim a tier
 * that never ran (MUL-5390). Clearing unconditionally is worse though — moving
 * between two models that both support Fast would throw the user's choice away,
 * and clearing while the catalog is unknown would delete a value the daemon
 * would have honoured.
 *
 * So: clear only what the authoritative catalog says the new model does not
 * support. Unknown catalog, unknown model, or an empty model ("follow the
 * runtime default", which resolves from the daemon host's own config and cannot
 * be checked here) leave the stored values untouched — they stay visible in the
 * inspector so the user can clear them explicitly.
 *
 * Both clears travel with the model in ONE request: a second follow-up write
 * would leave a window where the agent is persisted with a model/tier
 * combination the UI never intended.
