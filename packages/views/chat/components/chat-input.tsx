  // is "the chat I have not created yet", and `selectedAgentId` only decides
  // where the first send goes (MUL-4864). This is a STORAGE key, not a React
  // identity.
  //
  // `editorKey` — React `key` on the ContentEditor, i.e. editor identity. It is
  // constant for the chat composer, because nothing about switching what you
  // are composing to should throw away the instance you are typing in:
  //   - Agent switch: same draft slot now, so a remount would only serve to
  //     drop the last <100ms of typing the draft debounce has not persisted.
  //   - Placeholder: ContentEditor's placeholder-sync effect refreshes it live,
  //     so it never needed a remount.
  //   - Draft restore (a cancelled run, a failed send): writes into
  //     `inputDraft`, and the editor's synchronized-value effect pushes it into
  //     the live instance. There is no second copy to drift or resurface.
  //   - Session switch / lazy create: sending from a brand-new chat flips
  //     `activeSessionId` from null → uuid while an upload's blob preview may
  //     still be in the document. A session-keyed editor would unmount right
  //     then, dropping the image node before file-upload.ts could swap in the
  //     CDN URL — the user would watch the image flash on and vanish. Stable

  //    those bytes back and commits them to the key they were typed in.
  // 2. An in-flight upload. Guard 0 pins the document (see editorDraftKeyRef),
  //    so the switch cannot happen yet at all: we leave BOTH the document and
  //    its writes on the source key and retry when the gate clears
  //    (`uploadGate.uploading` is a dep). Blocking navigation instead would be
  //    a worse trade — the user waits on a network round-trip to change tabs.
