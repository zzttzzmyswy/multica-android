/**
 * Issue deliverables — the files an issue as a whole has produced (MUL-7649).
 *
 * A deliverable file is something uploaded in a comment. Attachments on the
 * issue description are inputs (the brief, reference material), not output,
 * so they never count.
 *
 * Re-uploading a file under the same name and type is a new VERSION of that
 * file, not another deliverable: agents iterate on a report or a screenshot
 * across runs, and the reader wants the latest one with its history behind
 * it, not five near-identical rows.
 *
 * Built from comment entries rather than the issue-wide attachment list: the
 * list is fetched before the upload is bound to its comment and is not
 * refreshed when that bind lands, while the timeline is patched live and
 * already carries each comment's attachments.
 *
 * Pure — no React, no DOM, no platform APIs. Mobile imports it too
 * (apps/mobile/CLAUDE.md: pure functions from @multica/core are importable),
 * which is why the identity rules below cannot be re-derived per client.
