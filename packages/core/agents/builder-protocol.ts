/**
 * Wire format between the Agent Creation Studio and the hidden builder agent.
 *
 * Two asymmetric directions:
 *   - Outbound, the composer's plain text is wrapped in a JSON envelope that
 *     also carries the current draft and the catalogs the builder may pick IDs
 *     from, so every turn re-states the full decision context.
 *   - Inbound, the builder appends one `<agent_draft>` JSON block to its natural
 *     language reply; the block updates the form and is stripped before the
 *     message is rendered.
 *
 * Both directions are parsed defensively: a CLI-backed model can emit slightly
 * malformed JSON, and a draft that fails to parse must degrade to "no form
 * update" rather than breaking the conversation.
