/**
 * Per-comment draft persistence — survives:
 *  - virtualization unmount (the reason this exists: when a TipTap editor
 *    scrolls out of the Virtuoso viewport, its in-memory state is lost)
 *  - tab close / accidental Cmd-W
 *  - reload
 *
 * A draft holds both the in-progress text AND the uploads started in the same
 * composer session (MUL-5181). Uploads used to live in component `useState`,
 * so closing or scrolling the composer away dropped in-flight and already-
 * uploaded files; persisting them here keeps them recoverable exactly like the
 * text. Each upload is a {@link DraftUpload} that carries its status — an
 * in-flight placeholder (owned by the upload coordinator) becomes the full
 * attachment once it settles, and a placeholder still `uploading` at load time
 * is coerced to `interrupted` because the bytes were never persisted.
 *
 * Keys are issue-scoped because createWorkspaceAwareStorage only partitions
 * by workspace, not by issue. Without issueId in the key, two issues with
 * thread replies open in adjacent desktop tabs would collide.
