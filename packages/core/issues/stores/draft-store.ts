// One logical Issue-Create draft (MUL-5181), split so switching between the
// manual form and the agent form never destroys the other side's content.
//
//   shared  — belongs to the issue no matter how it is filed: project,
//             priority, due date, attachments.
//   manual  — the manual form's own state: title, description, status, start
//             date, assignee, labels, custom properties.
//   agent   — the agent form's own state: the free-text prompt and the picked
//             actor (agent or squad).
//   activeMode — which form the draft is currently being edited in.
//
// Before this split, `switchToAgent` concatenated title + description into the
// prompt and then CLEARED the manual fields, and `switchToManual` copied the
// prompt into the description but left the old prompt behind — so a round-trip
// both lost manual content and resurfaced a stale prompt. With separate slots
// a switch is a no-op on the other side's data; the only cross-write is a
// one-time assist-init the panels perform when the target slot is still empty.
