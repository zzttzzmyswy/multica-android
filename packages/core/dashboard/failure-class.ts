// spike means "go re-auth", a rate-limit spike means "back off or raise the
// cap", a runtime spike means "a daemon is down". The raw reason stays on the
// wire and is still shown in the breakdown, so nothing is lost.

// breakdown rows): most-actionable first, catchall last, so the chart's
// colour ramp reads consistently regardless of which classes a workspace
