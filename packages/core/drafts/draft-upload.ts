 * Persistable upload placeholder + result (MUL-5181, L2).

 * upload that was still mid-flight when the composer closed had no persisted
 * representation: reopening showed nothing, and a reload/app-restart left no
 * trace that a file had ever been dropped. Modelled on Linear's local store
 * (a first-class `uploads` record carrying `uploadId` + `uploadState`, linked
 * to the draft), a `DraftUpload` lives in the persisted draft from the moment
 * the file is picked, so the upload's lifecycle survives the component that
 * started it.
 *
 * The `clientUploadId` is a client-minted id that ties the placeholder to the
 * module-level {@link UploadCoordinator} running the actual request. It is NOT
 * the server attachment id (which does not exist until the upload completes).
