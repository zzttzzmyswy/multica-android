-- An issue whose group still has an active row is excluded: archiving is
-- issue-level, so a NEW notification on an already-archived issue leaves the
-- old archived rows in place alongside the fresh active one. The issue belongs
-- in the main inbox at that point, and the two lists must stay mutually
-- exclusive per issue group — otherwise the same issue renders in both. The
-- exclusion lives here rather than in the client so neither list depends on
-- the other's cache being loaded. Items without an issue_id group on their own
-- id and can never have an active sibling, hence the IS NULL short-circuit.
--
-- LIMIT bounds the response while the archive grows without end (v1 ships no
-- pagination). Rows are newest-first, so truncation drops the OLDEST rows and
-- can never hide a group's newest row — the one the deduplicated UI renders.
