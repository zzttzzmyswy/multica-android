-- Persist a group only after the shared inbound router has accepted the @bot
-- message and validated the sender's identity/workspace membership. The INSERT
-- default is the installation's agent; a later admin reassignment survives
-- subsequent inbound events because the conflict update refreshes only the
-- human-readable title. The returned active bit revalidates the effective route
-- target at runtime while preserving the route across archive/restore. The
-- workspace/installation locks serialize discovery with teardown and revoke:
-- revoke-first rechecks status after the wait and returns no row; discovery-
-- first completes before revoke, matching the existing in-flight semantics.
