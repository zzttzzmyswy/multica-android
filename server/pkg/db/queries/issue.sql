-- involves_user_id widens the assignee filter to surface issues where the user
-- is *indirectly* the assignee — via an owned agent or a squad they belong to /
-- lead / have an agent inside. The semantics intentionally exclude direct
-- member assignment (`assignee_type='member' AND assignee_id=involves_user_id`)
-- because that is already the meaning of the `assignee_id` filter (tab 1
-- "Assigned to me"), and the two filters must produce disjoint result sets.
