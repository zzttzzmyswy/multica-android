-- sliced to calendar days under the caller-supplied @tz. Optionally
-- scoped to a single project via sqlc.narg('project_id'). Powers the
-- workspace dashboard's daily cost chart.
-- The viewer's tz is applied here at query time, so a viewer in
-- Asia/Shanghai gets their "today" cut at +08 and one in
-- America/Los_Angeles gets theirs at -08 against the same UTC rows.
--
-- @since is already the viewer's local start-of-day-(N) as a UTC
-- instant (computed by parseSinceParamInTZ). It must NOT be re-truncated
-- with DATE_TRUNC here — DATE_TRUNC operates in the session tz and would
-- snap the cutoff back to UTC midnight, dragging in an extra partial
-- local day for any non-UTC viewer.
-- provider is LOWER()-normalized so mixed-case historical rows (written
-- before the handler lowercased provider on write) merge with new rows
-- instead of forming a separate case-variant bucket.

-- name: ListDashboardUsageByAgent :many
-- Per-(agent, provider, model) token aggregates from `task_usage_hourly`. No

-- @since cutoff is a raw timestamptz the Go layer has already computed
-- in the viewer's tz. Model dimension is preserved so the client can
-- compute cost from its per-model pricing table; the client folds rows
-- by agent for the "by agent" list on the dashboard.
--
-- task_count is summed across hourly buckets — one task that spans
-- multiple hours lands in multiple buckets, so this over-counts by
-- hour the same way the daily version over-counted by day. The
-- frontend prefers `ListDashboardAgentRunTime` for the user-facing
-- "tasks" column, so this stays informational only.
-- provider is LOWER()-normalized so mixed-case historical rows merge with
-- new rows (see ListDashboardUsageDaily).
