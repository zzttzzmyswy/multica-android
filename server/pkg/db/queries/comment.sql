-- discussion but also triage which thread to drill into (biggest / most

--
-- `selected_roots` picks the roots we will actually return first (the chrono
-- page of size @row_limit), so the recursive `membership` walk only expands
-- those threads' subtrees instead of every thread in the issue. membership
-- labels each comment with its thread root by walking down from the selected
-- roots, so the counts stay correct even if the schema ever allows
-- reply-of-reply (the write path collapses to root today, but does not enforce
-- it). Mirrors ListRecentThreadCommentsForIssue's stats CTE.

--
-- Why thread-grouped instead of row-recent: with row-recent the newest 20
-- comments can come from 8 different threads — the agent sees 8 unrelated

--

--   threads:     (thread_last_activity_at ASC, root_id ASC)

-- with (last_activity_at, root_id) < (@before_at, @before_id) are eligible.
