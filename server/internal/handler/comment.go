//
//   - unresolved thread     → every comment kept, unchanged, no annotation.
//   - reply-resolved thread → keep the thread root + the resolution reply (the
//     conclusion), drop every other reply. Root + conclusion, never conclusion
//     alone: a conclusion is often referential ("go with what we said above")
//     and unreadable without the root question.
//   - root-resolved thread  → keep only the root, drop every reply (the whole
//     discussion was a settled dead-end; the root states the topic).
//
// The thread root of each resolved thread is annotated (foldStat keyed by the
// root's id string) so the response can mark it thread_resolved and report how

// callers and the desktop UI keep working as-is. Optional query params give
// agent-style readers bounded views that scale to long issues without dragging
// every prior reply into context:
//
//   - roots_only=true — return only top-level comments (parent_id IS NULL),
//     each annotated with reply_count + last_activity_at so the caller can
//     triage which thread to drill into. May combine with since for incremental
//     polling of newly created roots, but is exclusive with thread/recent/tail/
//     cursor modes because those have their own grouping or pagination semantics.
//
//   - summary=true — orthogonal content projection. Clips each returned
//     comment's content to a fixed budget and sets content_truncated, so an
//     agent can scan a list cheaply before pulling a full body. Composes with
//     every mode (default, since, thread, recent, roots_only).
//
//   - fold=true — resolve-aware thread projection. Collapses each resolved
//     thread to root + conclusion (reply-resolved) or root only (root-resolved),
//     reusing the human timeline fold so an agent does not pay tokens for
//     settled discussion. The resolved thread's root carries thread_resolved +
//     folded_count; `--full` (no fold param) brings the dropped comments back.
//     Needs whole threads to compute a resolution, so it is rejected with since,
//     tail, and roots_only (partial-thread / reply-less reads) and composes with
//     the default list, recent, untailed thread, and summary.
//
//   - thread=<comment-uuid> — return the root of the thread containing this
//     comment plus every descendant. The anchor may be a root or any reply;
//     the server walks up to the root via a recursive CTE, so callers do not
//     need to know whether the id they have is a root.
//
//   - tail=<N> — only valid with thread. Cap the reply count at the N most
//     recent replies (per (created_at, id)). The thread root is always
//     returned, even when N=0, so the reader keeps the "what is this thread
//     about" context. Without tail, thread returns the entire thread (the
//     pre-MUL-2421 behavior).
//
//   - recent=<N> — return the N most recently active threads (root + every
//     descendant per thread). A thread's recency is MAX(created_at) across
//     the whole subtree, so a stale-but-recently-replied thread ranks ahead
//     of an active-but-quiet one. Row-based "newest N comments" is
//     deliberately NOT exposed — it surfaces unrelated thread tails and
//     hides relevant history (#2340).
//
//   - before=<RFC3339> + before-id=<uuid> — cursor. The pair's meaning is
//     context-dependent so the flag surface stays small:
//
//   - with recent: a *thread* cursor — (last_activity_at, root_id) — and
//     the next page returns threads strictly less recent.
//
//   - with thread + tail: a *reply* cursor — (created_at, id) — and the
//     next page returns replies in the same thread strictly older than
//     that reply.
//
// Both values must be set together so the cursor can tie-break entries
// landing in the same microsecond. The cursor for the next page is
// emitted via the X-Multica-Next-Before / X-Multica-Next-Before-Id
// response headers.
//
// Combination rules (kept narrow on purpose — Elon flagged the matrix risk):
//
//   - roots_only is exclusive with thread, recent, tail, and before/before-id.
//     It may combine with since. This keeps "list issue roots" separate from
//     "read a specific thread" and "read recently active threads".
//   - thread is exclusive with recent. Asking for "the most recent N within
//     thread X" mixes two different navigation models and is rejected.
//   - thread + before/before-id requires tail. Without tail, thread returns
//     the entire thread and a cursor would be ignored — reject loudly so
//     the documented "cursor scrolls within a tailed window" rule holds.
//   - tail requires thread (it is a thread-scoped limit; outside of thread
//     it has no defined behavior).
//   - thread may combine with since (incremental polling of one thread),
//     and the since filter is applied after the tail/cursor cut so the
//     thread root is still emitted but stale rows drop out.
//   - recent may combine with before/before-id (scroll older threads) and
//     with since (recent activity in a window).
//
// The response body is always chronological (oldest → newest); under recent
// that means threads are listed oldest-active first and the freshest thread
// sits at the tail, closest to "now" in an agent prompt.
