//
//   - file has no marker block → no-op (nothing was ever injected here);
//   - block is at the start of the file with no preceding managed
//     separator → the file was created by Inject from a missing-file
//     state. Remove the file outright so the post-cleanup directory
//     listing is byte-identical to the pre-Inject one.

//     an empty pre-existing file, a whitespace-only file, or arbitrary
//     user content) is the user's original file, written back verbatim

// the user inside the same directory after a Multica task would pick up
