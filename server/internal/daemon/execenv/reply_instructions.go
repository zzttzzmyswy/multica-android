// The explicit "do not reuse --parent from previous turns" wording exists
// because resumed Claude sessions keep prior turns' tool calls in context
// and will otherwise copy the old --parent UUID forward.
//
// The template is provider- and platform-aware:
//
//   - Windows + any provider → write a UTF-8 file, post with `--content-file`.
//     This is the only path that survives Windows shells (PowerShell 5.1
//     defaults to ASCIIEncoding when piping to native commands and drops
//     non-ASCII as `?`; cmd.exe is at the mercy of `chcp`). The original
//     reports — #2198 (Chinese), #2236 (Chinese), #2376 (Cyrillic, observed
//     on a non-Codex agent) — all match this signature.
//   - Linux/macOS + Codex → stdin/HEREDOC. Codex tends to emit literal `\n`
//     escapes inside `--content "..."` and produce broken multi-line stored
//     comments (MUL-1467); stdin sidesteps that.
//   - Linux/macOS + non-Codex → lightweight inline `--content "..."`.
//     The CLI's `util.UnescapeBackslashEscapes` decodes `\n` server-side,
//     so escaped multi-line works correctly. This is the pre-#1795 default,
//     restored after we found #1795 / #1851 had expanded a Codex-specific
//     fix into a global mandate that broke Windows non-ASCII for every
//     provider.
