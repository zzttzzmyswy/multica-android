// The channel-media intent ledger's reconciler settings are fixed constants,
// not configuration: whether they ever need tuning is decided from the
// reconciler metrics.
//
// What the state machine fences, and what the schedule fences:
//
//   - bind vs. delete is fenced by STATE. Once a claim flips a row to
//     'deleting', neither a new upload nor BindMediaRefs can resurrect or
//     attach that key, so the post-claim reference check cannot race a late
//     COMMIT. No timing assumption is involved.
//   - a PUT the client already abandoned cannot be ordered against a DELETE at
//     all: the store may materialize the object after the delete completes.
//     That is fenced by the TOMBSTONE schedule instead of by a single timing
//     bet: after deleting an unreferenced object the row is kept and the
//     object re-deleted on a widening schedule, so a late materialization is
//     reclaimed by a later pass. Escaping requires the object to appear only
//     after the whole schedule has elapsed (see channelMediaTombstoneRedelete).
//     Every pass re-checks the reference first: reclaiming an orphan must
//     never outrank keeping an object something durably reads.
//
// The settle delay therefore carries no correctness weight for bind/commit and
// only sets how long the reconciler waits before treating a pending row as
// abandoned; the tested invariant is settle >> every media/HTTP/DB budget in
// the pipeline (see cmd/server channel media invariant test).
//
// Every deadline below is a DURATION handed to SQL, never a timestamp computed
// here: Postgres derives settle cutoffs, lease expiry, backoff and re-delete
// times from its own now(), so replicas with drifting clocks all read the same
// clock. An app-side timestamp would let a fast replica settle rows whose
// upload is still in flight, or hand out a lease that is already expired.
