// Package wecom is the WeCom (企业微信) smart-bot ("智能机器人" / aibot)
// adapter for the channel-agnostic inbound engine (MUL-3620). It plugs into the
// same engine.Router / ResolverSet as Feishu and Slack.
//
// Unlike the internal customer-service ("内部客服号") flow which is HTTP-callback
// based, the smart-bot flow is a client-initiated WebSocket long connection
// against wss://openws.work.weixin.qq.com. Each installation carries a
// (bot_id, secret) pair; after the WS handshake the client subscribes with
// aibot_subscribe and thereafter receives aibot_msg_callback events and sends
// aibot_send_msg / aibot_respond_msg / aibot_upload_media_* over the same
// socket. No public callback URL is required.
//
// One installation = one bot = one WebSocket. WeCom allows only one active
// connection per bot; a second connection kicks the first with a
// disconnected_event. That single-active-connection guarantee lines up with
// engine.Supervisor's WS lease, so the multi-replica invariant (at most one
// active connection per installation across processes) already holds without
// wecom-specific code.
//
// Maintenance: this package is COMMUNITY-MAINTAINED. @leroy-chen contributed it
// and co-owns it with @seacen — they are the first stop for WeCom-specific bugs
// and behavior questions, on a best-effort volunteer basis. The Multica team
// keeps this package compiling and its tests green through shared-layer
// refactors, but does not use WeCom and cannot verify behavior against the real
// platform; that part depends on the code owners. If the integration breaks in a
// way that cannot be fixed without real WeCom access and no fix lands for a few
// releases, it may be deprecated rather than left quietly broken. Changing the
// shared channel engine? Keep this adapter building — and loop in the code
// owners for anything that changes WeCom-visible behavior.
//
// Known limits of the first version, both deliberate: inbound handling is
// text-only (other message types get a short "text only" receipt), and outbound
// delivery requires a SINGLE backend replica, because the only send path is the
// in-process WebSocket in sendersRegistry while EventChatDone dispatches on the
// in-process events.Bus. See SELF_HOSTING.md.
