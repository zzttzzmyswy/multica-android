// senders_registry.go — a small process-wide map from installation_id to
// live wsSender. wecomChannel.Connect adds an entry on entry and clears it
// on exit; OutboundReplier and Outbound look up by installation id to push
// aibot_send_msg over the same socket the inbound loop owns (aibot has no
// REST outbound path; every write goes over the WebSocket). wecomChannel.Send
// is not a reader — it returns ErrSendNotSupported.
//
// Why a registry rather than storing the sender on wecomChannel:
// OutboundReplier is created once at boot with the shared engine.Router
// and does not have per-installation Channel handles. When the engine
// invokes Replier.Reply, it passes engine.ResolvedInstallation carrying
// the installation id, not the Channel. The registry is the seam that
// lets the boot-time Replier reach the per-installation live connection
// without threading the Channel through the engine.

// loser's defer runs after the winner's set. Deleting unconditionally there
// leaves the registry empty while a healthy connection is up, and every
// outbound push resolves to nil — the bot goes silent with nothing in the log
// to say why, until the next reconnect happens to re-register.
