 * web (matching `WindowOverlay` on desktop); content is the shared
 * `<OnboardingFlow />`. Kept minimal — guard on auth, render, exit.
 *
 * On complete: if a workspace was just created, navigate into it;
 * otherwise fall back to root (proxy / landing picks the user's first ws
 * or bounces to onboarding if still zero).
 *
 * `CliInstallInstructions` is passed in as the `runtimeInstructions`
 * slot so the flow can render it inside the CLI dialog. The commands it
 * shows are hardcoded — nothing environmental to thread through.
