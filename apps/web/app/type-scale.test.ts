/**
 * Does the product still have exactly one type scale?
 *
 * Before `--text-*` existed in tokens.css there was no baseline to align to, so
 * font sizes grew wherever they were needed: 51 distinct sizes across web and
 * desktop, 370 written as arbitrary pixel values, six of those at half a pixel
 * (10.5 / 11.5 / 12.5 / 13.5 / 14.5 / 15.5px). A scale only holds if going off
 * it is harder than staying on it, and nothing in a Tailwind build makes an
 * off-scale arbitrary size look wrong — it compiles exactly like a token does.
 *
 * So the guard lives here. This asserts on source text rather than on rendered
 * components because the failure mode is authorial, not behavioural: a
 * component test would prove a class name renders, never that the class was one
 * of the ten the design system actually defines.
 *
 * Any unit counts, not just px. The first sweep of this migration only looked
 * for `px` and so walked straight past four `0.8rem` call sites in
 * packages/ui — an off-scale size is off-scale however it is spelled.
 *
 * Scope is product UI. `apps/mobile` builds through its own NativeWind config
 * and `apps/docs` rides fumadocs' type system; both keep Tailwind's default
 * scale on purpose and are not scanned.
