        question: "What coding agents does Multica support?",
        answer:
          "Multica currently supports Claude Code and OpenAI Codex out of the box. The daemon auto-detects whichever CLIs you have installed. More backends are on the roadmap \u2014 and since it\u2019s open source, you can add your own.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to self-host, or is there a cloud version?",
        answer:
          "Both. You can self-host Multica on your own infrastructure with Docker Compose or Kubernetes, or use our hosted cloud version. Your data, your choice.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "How is this different from just using Claude Code or Codex directly?",
        answer:
          "Coding agents are great at executing. Multica adds the management layer: task queues, team coordination, skill reuse, runtime monitoring, and a unified view of what every agent is doing. Think of it as the project manager for your agents.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can agents work on long-running tasks autonomously?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Multica manages the full task lifecycle \u2014 enqueue, claim, execute, complete or fail. Agents report blockers proactively and stream progress in real time. You can check in whenever you want or let them run overnight.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is my code safe? Where does agent execution happen?",
        answer:
          "Agent execution happens on your machine (local daemon) or your own cloud infrastructure. Code never passes through Multica servers. The platform only coordinates task state and broadcasts events.",
      },
      {
        question: "How many agents can I run?",
        answer:
          "As many as your hardware supports. Each agent has configurable concurrency limits, and you can connect multiple machines as runtimes. There are no artificial caps in the open source version.",
