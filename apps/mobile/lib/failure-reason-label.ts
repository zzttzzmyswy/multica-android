/**
 * Mirror of `packages/views/agents/components/tabs/task-failure.ts:REASON_LABEL`.
 *
 * Why mirror: mobile cannot import from packages/views per the apps/mobile
 * CLAUDE.md sharing rule. Only the human copy is mobile-owned.
 *
 * Keyed by the raw wire value rather than a closed enum, same as the web map:
 * `failure_reason` is an open string that grows as classifier rules land, and
 * an installed build will meet reasons it predates. Before MUL-5370 this was a
 * `Record<TaskFailureReason, string>` holding only the six pre-MUL-1949 coarse
 * values, so every refined `agent_error.*` the backend has written since
 * missed the lookup and rendered a bare "Failed".
 *
 * Divergence from web, deliberate: the web helper falls back to the raw wire
 * value, which is machine-y but searchable — right for an operator reading the
 * execution log. This one backs a chat bubble read by the person who just sent
 * a message, so an unrecognised reason degrades to a plain "Failed" instead of
 * leaking an enum string at them.
