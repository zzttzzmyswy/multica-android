/**
 * Pure data for an issue's run timeline — mobile port of web's
 * `packages/views/issues/components/issue-run-timeline.ts`.
 *
 * The runs sheet answers "what is running and what just ran"; this answers
 * "how did this issue get here": when each run happened, how long it took, and
 * which ones moved the total. Everything the two surfaces draw — bar
 * positions, the cumulative cost curve, day groups — is derived here, so the
 * rendering code only maps numbers to pixels and the arithmetic has one place
 * to be tested.
 *
 * Money is never re-derived here: a run's cost comes from
 * `lib/task-usage.ts`'s `summarizeTaskUsage` / `estimateCostBreakdown`, the
 * same helpers the runs header chip and the per-run breakdown dialog use. A
 * second price formula would let the curve disagree with the total that opened
 * it.
 *
 * Deliberate deviations from the web module, each noted at its site:
 *  - `taskDurationMs` is inlined in `toTimelineRun` rather than imported from a
 *    shared labels module — mobile has no `task-run-labels.ts` equivalent, and
 *    the body is four lines of parsing
 *  - ES2023 array methods (`.toSorted` / `.findLastIndex`) are avoided per the
 *    Hermes note in `lib/usage-format.ts`
