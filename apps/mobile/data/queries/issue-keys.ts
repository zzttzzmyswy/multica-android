/**
 * Centralised TanStack Query keys for issue-domain queries on mobile.
 *
 * Prefix shape mirrors web's `packages/core/issues/queries.ts` so the same
 * WS invalidation surface (e.g. `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: issueKeys.myAll(wsId) })`)
 * eventually drives both clients. Keys are workspace-scoped — switching
 * workspace flips wsId and the cache moves automatically (root CLAUDE.md
 * "Workspace-scoped queries must key on wsId").
